# AgileCampusTour

This is the source code of the Sinatra app behind agilecampustour.org

## Prerequisites

* Ruby 1.9.2
* Bundler 1.0.7
* RVM (optional)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

    $ git clone <act_repository_url>
    $ cd AgileCampusTour

If you use RVM, you might want a .rvmrc file:

    rvm use 1.9.2-p0@agilecampustour
 
Install gems:

    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle install

Run the app:

    $ cd <path_to_act_repository>
    $ rackup
    
## Development

You can use *shotgun* to make the application reload on each request. use it to run the app instead of rackup:

    $ cd <path_to_act_repository>
    $ gem install shotgun
    $ shotgunx

## Deployment

### Setup

We have a staging and production servers, set them up:

    $ cd <path_to_act_repository>
    $ git remote add staging git@heroku.com:agilecampustour-staging.git
    $ git remote add production git@heroku.com:agilecampustour.git
    
### Staging server

The *master* branch should be the only branch to be deployed onto our staging server:

    $ git push staging master
    
### Development server

The *production* branch should be the only branch to be deployed onto our production server:

    $ git push production production:master
    
It is important to specify the remote *master* branch after the column (:); Heroku does not care about other branches.
